## Deployment Strategy

### API Deployment

1. **Elastic Beanstalk**: PaaS to deploy the API, managing the infrastructure like EC2, load balancers, and autoscaling.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Create a Beanstalk application for Django, handling deployment, scaling, and updates.
     2. Load Balancing and Auto Scaling is done automatically.
     3. Use environment variables for configurations to ensure flexibility in different environments (e.g., dev, prod).
  
2. **AWS Lambda + API Gateway**: A serverless alternative where Lambda functions serve the API, triggered by API Gateway.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Cost-efficient, as Lambda only incurs costs when functions are executed.
     - Automatically scales with incoming requests.
   - **Best Use Case**: Ideal for sporadic API requests or applications with unpredictable traffic.

### Database Deployment

1. **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)**:
   - **Steps**:
     1. Set up an RDS PostgreSQL instance to handle the API’s database needs.
     2. Enable **Multi-AZ** for redundancy and automatic failover to ensure high availability.
     3. Utilize **Read Replicas** for managing high read traffic, improving performance.
     4. Secure the database using **AWS Secrets Manager** to store and retrieve credentials securely.

### Scheduled Data Ingestion

1. **AWS Lambda + EventBridge**:
   - Use Lambda for serverless execution of data ingestion tasks.
   - Schedule these tasks with **EventBridge** to automate daily or weekly ingestion processes.
   - Secure access to the RDS instance using **Secrets Manager** to ensure sensitive credentials are protected.

2. **AWS Glue** for more complex or larger data ingestion tasks.
   - A fully managed ETL service, suitable for complex data transformations.
   - Glue jobs can be scheduled for periodic ingestion of larger datasets, processing them into a format suitable for analysis or storage in the database.

### Security and Monitoring

1. **Security**:
   - Use **IAM Roles** for managing permissions across AWS services, ensuring that the API and Lambda functions have the correct access rights.
   - Implement **VPC Security Groups** to control inbound and outbound traffic to both the API and the database.
   - Protect sensitive data, such as API keys and database credentials, using **AWS Secrets Manager** for secure storage.
   - Safeguard the API with **AWS WAF** (Web Application Firewall) and **AWS Shield** to protect against DDoS attacks and other common threats.

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Use **Amazon CloudWatch** for monitoring logs, setting up metrics, and configuring alarms based on key performance indicators (e.g., CPU usage, error rates).
   - Integrate **AWS X-Ray** for detailed request tracing, enabling you to analyze and debug performance bottlenecks or errors in the API’s lifecycle.

### Textual Architecture

1. **Frontend (API Gateway/Elastic Load Balancer)**: 
   - API requests will be routed through **API Gateway** (if using Lambda) or an **Elastic Load Balancer** (if using EC2/Elastic Beanstalk). 
   - API Gateway would trigger the **Lambda functions** upon incoming HTTP requests, which would then handle API logic.

2. **Backend (AWS Lambda or EC2 Instances)**: 
   - In the **serverless** deployment, AWS **Lambda functions** will execute the business logic of the API, such as fetching weather data or calculating statistics. 
   - Alternatively, for more predictable traffic, you could use **Elastic Beanstalk** to deploy a Django application on **EC2 instances**. Elastic Beanstalk will handle the scaling and load balancing.

3. **Database (Amazon RDS - PostgreSQL)**: 
   - **Amazon RDS** will host the PostgreSQL database, which stores the weather data and statistics. 
   - **Multi-AZ deployment** ensures high availability, while **Read Replicas** handle high read traffic, improving overall database performance.

4. **Scheduled Data Ingestion (AWS Lambda + EventBridge)**: 
   - **AWS EventBridge** will trigger scheduled data ingestion tasks (e.g., daily or weekly) via **AWS Lambda functions**. 
   - These Lambda functions will pull data from a designated source, process the data, and insert it into the **RDS PostgreSQL** database. For larger or more complex ingestion tasks, **AWS Glue** can be used.

5. **Security (IAM Roles, VPC, Secrets Manager)**: 
   - **IAM Roles** will control access to different AWS services, ensuring that the Lambda functions, EC2 instances, and other services only have the permissions they need.
   - **VPC Security Groups** will control inbound and outbound traffic to the API and database, ensuring secure communication between services.
   - **AWS Secrets Manager** will securely store credentials and sensitive data, allowing services to retrieve them dynamically during runtime without hardcoding sensitive information.

6. **Monitoring (CloudWatch & X-Ray)**: 
   - **Amazon CloudWatch** will monitor logs, set up alarms, and collect metrics from all services, enabling proactive management of the API and backend infrastructure.
   - **AWS X-Ray** will provide tracing capabilities, helping you identify and resolve performance bottlenecks or slow API requests by visualizing the flow of requests across services.

This deployment architecture leverages AWS services to create a robust, scalable, and secure API for weather data and statistics. The serverless approach (AWS Lambda + API Gateway) is ideal for cost-efficiency and dynamic scaling, while Elastic Beanstalk with EC2 provides a more traditional, auto-scaled infrastructure for heavier workloads.
